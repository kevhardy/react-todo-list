# Todo List App

A simple Todo List app used for learning the basics of React. You can create or delete todo items and strikeout ones that are completed.

## Setup

First, ensure that you have Node.js (version 6 or greater) and `npm` (preferably
the latest stable release) installed. Then,

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/kevhardy/react-todo-list.git
$ cd react-todo-list/
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

To run the app in development mode:

```bash
$ npm start
```

This runs app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

```bash
$ npm run build
```

This builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
